1.  Front-end Development:

    Create an HTML page with a form that captures the required information from the user, such as 
        amount to borrow, 
        payment frequency, 
        loan period, 
        start date, 
        and interest type (reducing balance or flat rate).
    Use jQuery to handle form submission and perform client-side validation on the input data.
    Upon form submission, send the input data to the server for processing.

2.  Server-side Development:

    Build a server-side script (using a language of your choice) that receives the input data from the form and performs the loan calculations based on the selected interest type (reducing balance or flat rate).
    Implement the loan calculation logic, taking into account the interest rates, processing fees, excise duty, legal fees, and payment frequency.
    Generate the loan instalment breakdown, including the charges and the take-home amount.
    Provide the option to download the instalments as a PDF file or email it to a specified email address.

3.  API Development:

    Create an API (using a language and framework of your choice) that exposes the loan calculation functionality to external parties.
    Define the API endpoints for receiving loan calculation requests with the required input data.
    Implement the loan calculation logic in the API, similar to the server-side script.
    Return the loan instalment breakdown as a response in a format that can be consumed by external parties.

4.  Project Structure:
  
    Keep the web application and the API in separate projects to follow the requirement of not having them in the same project.

    Organize the codebase using a modular and maintainable structure, following best practices for the chosen programming language and framework.
    Use version control to track changes and collaborate with other team members.

5.  Additional Features:

    Add error handling to handle invalid input data or unexpected errors during loan calculation.
    Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to the loan calculator.
    Provide a visually appealing and responsive user interface for the web application.
    Implement localization to support multiple languages for a wider audience.
    Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the loan calculation logic.
    Once you have completed the development, thoroughly test the web application and API to ensure they are functioning correctly and meeting the requirements. Make sure to follow best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
